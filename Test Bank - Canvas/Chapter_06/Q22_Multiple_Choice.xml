        <span>Robert notices that several respondents did not answer the question of whether they took out loans to fund their education. However, later in his survey, Robert finds that respondents told him about the source(s) and the amount(s) of their college loans. In handling the missing data on the question of whether or not they had a college loan, Robert's best approach is to:</span>
