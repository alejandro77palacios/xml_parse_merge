          <span>You have been developing an antismoking campaign for high school students that has showed promising results in small tests. The campaign is being funded by the FDA, which is ready to hire you and make your campaign national if it shows success in broader experiments. You have identified two high schools in New York City that have similar student profiles and have received permission to conduct your first full-scale test of your antismoking campaign. You intend to present your campaign to classes in one school and have no intervention in the other school.</span>
